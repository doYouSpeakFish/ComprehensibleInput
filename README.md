# Comprehensible Input

Children learn language by listening to comprehensible input.  They don't learn by memorizing
vocabulary lists or grammar rules.  They don't learn by doing grammar drills or by taking
grammar tests.  They learn by listening to comprehensible input.

This app is designed to make it easier to find and share comprehensible input. In order to help
each other as a language learning community.
