# Comprehensible Input

Children learn language by listening to comprehensible input.  They don't learn by memorizing
vocabulary lists or grammar rules.  They don't learn by doing grammar drills or by taking
grammar tests.  They learn by listening to comprehensible input.

The goal of this app is to provide sources of comprehensible input for language learning.
