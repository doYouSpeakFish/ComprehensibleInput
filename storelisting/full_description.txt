Being an intermediate language learner is hard. Basic language learning apps stop being fun, and it takes a lot of effort to see tangible improvements.
This app aims to help you stop feeling like you are a student of the language and start feeling like you are using the language. Read stories that are written with accessible vocabulary, so the words you don't understand, you can work out from the surrounding context. Images provide additional context, helping you to stay immersed.
